### v1.1.0
* Bug Fixes:
    * #1 on program start the user can decide to use a own word or a random one from file.
      If you chose to use an own word, but then entered an empty one, you where stuck in an endless loop.
    * in-game if you accidentally entered an empty character to guess, the program crashed

* Enhancements:
    * #3 on loose you never knew what the word actually was. That's not very fair
    * #2  the game can now differentiate if a word or a letter was entered to guess. So if the word was wrong you'll
      be one step closer to death, too.
    * #4  after the game you have the choice to replay the game
